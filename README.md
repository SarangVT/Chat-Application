This is a Chat Application UI, intended primarily for frontEnd Design Dash Hackathon of Programming Club, IIT Indore.
Its Tech Stack is pure React-JS, with some additional dependencies like TailwindCSS and some npm plugins.

How to Set and Run this Web App?
Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/SarangVT/Chat-Application.git
Then, do 'npm install'
Then, just for running developers build, use 'npm start'
For production build, 
npm install -g serve
serve -s build

The time taken to build this is 2 days, completely.
Still, there are lot of funtionalities awaiting this app shortly, but still this is a project, because I did it.
